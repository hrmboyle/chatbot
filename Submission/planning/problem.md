## Chatbot

## Problem statement

Sometimes we are unsure of what it is we ought to do with our free time.

With this in mind, a chatbot has been created that takes users on an innovative and disruptive journey through a myriad of potential activities.

This journey is laced with sharp wit, and has a groundbreaking range of outcome. Some even challenge the fabric of our collective reality.

This is achieved through studious application of Javascript and HTML.

## Inputs, processes and outputs

INPUTS.

These are going to be what the user types. The input will vary from question to question. Namely, the opening questions will prompt non binary (yes or no) responses. Most questions will be "Yes" or "No".

Appropriate code will need to be added to accomodate for variety in grammatical syntax users will no doubt input.

Important to the chatbot is a reset/return feature which is mentioned to the user at the beginning of the conversation.

PROCESSES.

Processes are contextualised by the accompanying Excalidraw document. Basically, NO type inputs from the user are the key driver for further chatbot content.
Yes answers imply the users have come to their desired outcome. As a result an 'end' type message will be shown, this will include data relevant to the question they have answered.
